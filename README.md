# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

My name is Justin McCulloh and this is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. The idea of the landing page was to creater a fictional coffee shop that belongs to TripleTen.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think we should go more into depth on padding and spaces, also we should look more into more complex nesting in html.
